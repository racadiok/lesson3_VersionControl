            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is one way to solve a file sharing problem. What do you do when you want to recover past versions of a file? Many people save multiple files with different dates and file names. This is a horrible idea, especially when dealing with hundreds of files. It is impossible to manage. Also, when you have multiple members trying to access a file simultaneously, there are many issues. Version control is one main repository for all of the project files. Team members check files out, make changes, then check them back in (or commit). This solves the file sharing problem.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS Stands for version control system. To understand how these systems work, you first must understand what version control is, as mentioned above. These systems automatically note who changed the files (revision history), when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and merge changes to the same file. The benefits to this system are that the files cannot be overwritten, there is a common repository that holds all the latest files, people can work on the same file simultaneously without conflict, it allows you to revert back to an older version of the project/file if needed, and even though you don’t work with a team, the version control system will back up files so that you don’t lost your work or have to start over.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When a repository is created with files and directories, developers can record their change history and start tracking their status and versions. So no matter what, every change is recorded and the developers can track their files at every state. The remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. A local repository is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. There are two ways to create a local repository. You can create a brand new repository, or clone an existing remote repository onto your local machine.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one of the main Version Control Systems on the Internet. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. Git outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple work flows. Git stores and thinks about information much differently than other systems, even though the user interface is fairly similar.

                <span class="text-muted">How Does Git Work?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature file system. Every time you save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. This makes Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on top of it rather than simply a VCS. Most operations only need local files and resources to operate. Therefore, basically no information is needed from another computer on your network. This means there is very little you can not do when you are not connected to the server. Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. It generally adds on data to the Git database, and is hard to get the system to erase data in any way. The most important thing to remember is that Git has three main states: committed. modified, and staged.</p>
